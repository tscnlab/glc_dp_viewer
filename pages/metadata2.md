Metadata in GLEAM DP are expressed in a `datapackage.json` file. It follows the [Frictionless Data Package](https://specs.frictionlessdata.io/data-package/#specification) specification and includes standard **package-level metadata** together with **GLEAM-defined fields and resource structures** tailored to light exposure and optical measurement research. Required properties are indicated with an asterisk `*`. 

Dataset-specific metadata are organized into a set of related  resources, including `study`, `participant`, `device`, `dataset` and reference resources, which are declared and linked within the data package.
